## Purpose of the Application

WarmPaws is designed to support pet owners during the winter season by providing easy access to essential care services that help keep their pets warm, safe, and healthy. Winter often brings challenges such as cold temperatures, dry skin, paw damage from ice or salt, and the need for additional grooming or protective clothing. WarmPaws addresses these needs by offering a centralized platform where users can explore winter-specific pet care services, learn helpful seasonal tips, and connect with professionals.

The key objective is to make winter pet care simple, accessible, and informed through a clean, user-friendly, modern interface.
